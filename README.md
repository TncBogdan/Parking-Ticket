# Parking-Ticket
# It`s a parking ticket system, wherefrom a person can buy a ticket or make a subscription. On this project, we use Trello as a management tool, Spring MVC, MySQL, JSP, and work in teams of 2-3 persons. My team has to do access to the parking lot, pay the ticket, buy a subscription, and exit the parking.
